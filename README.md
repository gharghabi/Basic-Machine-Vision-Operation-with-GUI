Implementing basic vision function using Emgu
==============

This project includes the implementation of basic function in emgu for machine vision and image processing
In this project is inludeing of basic function for machine vision and image processing such as:
filtering:
1- blur
2- median
3- gaussian
Gray scale transformation:
1- Equalize histogram
2- sharp
3- negative
4- log gray
5- power gray
all kinds of noise:
1- peak
2- uniform
3- gaussian
4- poisson
Geometric transformation:
1- rotate
2- resize
3 flip
Edge detection algorithm:
1- canny
2- marr
3- navatia
4- sobel
contour detection:
1- border tracing
2- contour
Resolution pyramid and hough algorithm
Threshol image
1- binary 
2- binary inverse
3- zero
4- zero inverse
5- trunc
6- flood fill
7- adaptive 
8- color threshold
Motion detection in video and image algorithm
1- differential
2- cummulative
